Description: 
        This is a package for the discovery of Partially Methylated Domains from EPIC data. 
        It is based on the MethylseekR approach with alpha value estimation and HMM prediction.
        In contrast to WGBSdata, EPIC data is much more sparse and not uniformly distributed. 
        Therefore fixed windows like in MSR are unfit for predicting alpha values, 
        hence KNN is used to select the genomic neighrest neighbors. 
        Here Alpha Values are determined for multiple values of K and are than combinded 
        to smooth out alpha outliers.
        Also distance cutoff constrains are inplace to ensure
        that less biologically related DPs are pentalized.
