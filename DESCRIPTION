Description: 
        This is a package for the discovery of Partially Methylated Domains from EPIC data. 
        It is based on the MethylseekR approach (alpha value estimation and HMM prediction).
        In contrast to WGBSdata, EPIC data is much more sparse and not uniformly distributed. 
        Therefore fixed windows like in MSR are unfit for predicting alpha values, 
        hence KNN is used to select the nearest neighboring data points. Also a distance cutoff is 
        used, to allow for flexible neighborhood sizes if data points are located too far away.
        Alpha Values are determined for multiple parameters and are then combined 
        to smooth out alpha outliers for individual parameter setups.
